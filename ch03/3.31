When a new action procedure is added to a wire, the procedure is immediately run.
This initialization is necessary because it's just like connecting a wire to a power
supply. The wire should get a new signal after a delay specified by the black box
it's connected to. If it's not initialized immediately that the wire's signal won't
be updated until the previous wire connected the black box will change its signal.
So, if we have as an example the half adder and if the signals don't propagate
immediately, then after initializing the whole half adder the S and C values don't
change their values until A and B values change their.
